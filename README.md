# Florence

-[Demo](https://river-demo.herokuapp.com)

Florence is a conversational A.I. platform that manages patient adherence. Set goals for your patients, like "Exercise thirty minutes a day" or "Take your medication twice daily". Florence dynamically understands these goals and regularly checks in with your patients to track their progress. When they deviate from their goals, Florence works with them to understand why and report back any barriers they may encounter.
